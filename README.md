# kubernetes CI/CD Cloud

# Technical Report: CloudDeployPipeline

## Overview:
The CloudDeployPipeline is an automated deployment pipeline for an application, designed to facilitate continuous delivery (CI/CD) in a Kubernetes environment hosted on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The pipeline is built to build and deploy Docker images in both development and production scenarios, ensuring consistency and reliability in the software lifecycle.

## Technologies Used:
- GitLab CI/CD: The pipeline is configured and executed using GitLab CI/CD, an integrated continuous integration and continuous delivery tool within GitLab.
- Docker: Docker images are used to encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring portability and consistency across different environments.
- Kubernetes: Kubernetes is utilized as the container orchestration platform to deploy and manage application services in a scalable and resilient environment.
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): The pipeline infrastructure is hosted on GCP, including the container registry and Kubernetes cluster.

## Pipeline Description:

### Development Scenario:
- The pipeline is automatically triggered when new commits are pushed to the GitLab repository.
- A development Docker image is built from the application source code.
- The image is pushed to the GCP container registry, making it available for deployment in the development environment.

### Production Scenario:
- When a new version is tagged and pushed to the GitLab repository, the production pipeline is triggered.
- A production Docker image is built from the application source code.
- The image is pushed to the GCP container registry.
- Deployments in the Kubernetes cluster are updated with the new version of the image, ensuring continuous deployment of the application in production.

## Benefits and Usage:

- Automation of Deployment Process: The automated pipeline simplifies and speeds up the application deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to update and deploy new versions.
- Consistency and Reliability: The use of Docker containers and Kubernetes ensures consistency of the deployment environment across different stages of the software lifecycle, increasing the reliability of the application.
- Continuous Delivery: The pipeline supports continuous delivery practices, allowing new versions of the application to be delivered quickly and reliably to end users.

The CloudDeployPipeline is a robust and effective solution for implementing a CI/CD strategy in a Kubernetes environment on GCP, providing an agile and secure workflow for software development and deployment.
